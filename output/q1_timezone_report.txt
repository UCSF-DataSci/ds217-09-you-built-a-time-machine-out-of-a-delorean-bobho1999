TODO: Document your timezone operations:
- What timezone was your original data in?
A: We cannot tell which timezone the orginal data was in since there was no codebook to check, and the date column only contains the year, month, and day information.
- How did you localize the data?
A: To localize the data, we use the commend 'tz_localize('UTC')' to set all dates to UTC time.
- What timezone did you convert to?
A: After we localized the dates, we then convert them into 'US/Eastern' timezone using the commend 'tz_convert('US/Eastern')'.
- What issues did you encounter with DST? (Note: Using UTC avoids DST ambiguity)
A: With daylight saving times, it is likely that we will encounter unwanted missing or duplicate data in the dataset. 
In fall, when the cock shift back one hour, we will end up having 1:00 AM recorded twice (once in EDT and another in EST) in the dataset.
In spring, when the clock shift forward one hour, an entire hour is skipped and thus create missing data in the dataset.
- Include at least one example showing a datetime before and after conversion
A: 
    Before: Timestamp('2023-03-12 10:00:00+0000', tz='UTC')
    After: Timestamp('2023-03-12 06:00:00-0400', tz='US/Eastern')
- Explain why UTC is recommended as the base timezone for storing temporal data
A: UTC is recommended as the base timezone for storing temporal data because it does not have daylight saving. Therefore, we can avoid encountering problem with DST.
