- How did you localize the data?
- What timezone did you convert to?
- What issues did you encounter with DST? (Note: Using UTC avoids DST ambiguity)
- Include at least one example showing a datetime before and after conversion
- Explain why UTC is recommended as the base timezone for storing temporal data
