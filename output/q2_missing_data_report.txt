TODO: Document your missing data handling:
- How many missing values did you find?
A: 323 missing values were found in the dataset.
- What percentage of data was missing?
A: The missing values made up around 96.4% of the dataset.
- Which method did you use to fill missing values?
A: To fill the missing values, we tried the following methods: forward fill, backward fill, interpolation, Linear interpolation, time-based interpolation, rolling mean imputation.
Summary of missing value after applying each method: n(%)
    Forward fill: 0(0.0%)
    Backward fill: 0(0.0%)
    Interpolation: 0(0.0%)
    Linear interpolation: 0(0.0%)
    Time-based interpolation: 0(0.0%)
    Rolling mean imputation: 323(96.4%)
- Why did you choose that method?
A: From the summary above, we see how every method except the 'rolling mean imputation' successfully fill in all the missing values. 
If I were to choose one method only, I would probably choose 'time-based interpolation' because time series often have irregular gaps,
and time-based interpolation accounts for the actual time differences between points rather than assuming constant values between the 
gap like forward filling.
- What are the pros/cons of your approach?
A: Some pros of time-based interpolation include handling uneven intervals accurately and preserving temporal trends.
Some cons of the approach include requiring proper setup and potential poor performance with large gaps.
